## Overview

This project is a simple console chat room application that allows multiple users to communicate in real-time. Whether you want to chat with friends, family, or colleagues.

## How it Works

1. ***Registration:*** Users are provided with a unique client to register in the chat room. If they have already registered, they can simply log in.

2. ***Authorization:*** After registration, users are authorized and gain access to the chat room.

3. ***Message History:*** The chat displays the last 10 messages, including those sent before the user's authorization. This helps users catch up on the conversation.

4. ***Change Username:*** Users have the flexibility to change their login names. Other users will see the updates in real-time.

5. ***Message Verification:*** To maintain a clean and orderly chat, each message must end with one of the following characters: '.', '!', or '?'. Messages are also limited to 64 characters with ASCII codes greater than or equal to 32.

6. ***More Features:*** We are continuously working on adding more features to the chat room for enhanced convenience and functionality.
